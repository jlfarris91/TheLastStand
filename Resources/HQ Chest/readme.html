<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a High quality chest model for RPG maps, the model has custom animations and custom handdrawn textures. The model is meant to be used alongside my &quot;HQ Barrel&quot; Model and shares its color scheme, but not it&#039;s texture.<br />
<br />
The model has a death animation, aswell as Death and Birth alternate animations for opening and closing the chest.<br />
<br />
You are free to use, edit or reupload the model, if you&#039;re reuploading it anywhere just send me a PM.<br />
